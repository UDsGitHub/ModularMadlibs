# ModularMadlibs
A modular Madlibs program that can use any story and makes it a playable madlib game.

you would first need to convert each location where there is the word adjective, noun, or verb into (adj), (noun), and (verb) in the story string. This would allow the algortithm to recognize them easily. Later on, I would update the code to recognize the words adjective, noun and verb on ther own and reduce user workload.

Thank you. Have fun.
